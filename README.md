<h2>📱 Security System based on ESP8266</h2>

<img src="img/esp8266.jpg" width="200px"> <p><p>This ESP8266-based security system was developed as a bachelor’s thesis project at Wrocław University of Science and Technology and received a grade of 5 (A, Excellent). It provides real-time alerts for potential safety hazards, including:</p>

<ul> 

  <li> Fire detection alerts</li> 
  <li> CO<sub>2</sub> detection alerts</li> 
  <li> Water leak detection alerts</li> 
  <li> Motion detection alerts</li> 
  <li> Noise detection alerts</li> 
  
</ul> 

<h3>🌐 API (Flask)</h3> 

<p>The system communicates through an API built with Flask, hosted on Heroku. This API enables secure and efficient data exchange between the ESP8266 and the user interface.</p> 

<h3>🛠 Sensors Used</h3> 

<p>The security system utilizes the following sensors:</p> 

<ul> 
  
  <li>PIR Motion Sensor HC-SR505 with a 100° field of view and detection range up to 3 meters</li> 
  <li>Analog Liquid Level Sensor SE045</li> <li>Air Quality Sensor MQ-135 for detecting pollutants like benzene, ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</li> 
  <li>Sound Sensor with a built-in capacitive microphone</li> 
  <li>MC-38 Magnetic Door/Window Contact Sensor</li> </ul>
